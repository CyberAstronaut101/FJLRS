# Employee Module

This module should be loaded for an employee-board. Think dashboard with all the info and metrics showing here from all the printers, open job tickets, maybe like a global TODO board..

Extra functionalities that could be implemented could include maybe internal project management??

We could also make an account that has access to box to do the file exchange between the students and the lab, but I think the first thing to maybe think on that data transfer medium.. on GCP we can just bump the storage on the docker container if there are issues with MongoDB
