# Express.js Routes

This folder contains route files for the API. Essentially, this is just logically seperating out different API endpoints so we dont have one huge file with all the endpoints.

Line 155 in app.js to view where all these files are imported and then associated with their API endpoints. 

## API Documentation

We are utilizing swagger to autogenerate documentation based on the tags on routes. See `fjlrs.com/api-docs` or `localhost:8080/api-docs`
